            <p>Hi, I'm Jessica!</p>
            <p>I'm a sophomore at Brown University studying computer science, with a concentration in artificial intelligence/machine learning;
              I'm especially interested by technical approaches to algorithmic fairness and interpretable AI.</p>
            <p>I care a lot about the potential applications of tech;
              I was a core team member for the first year of <a href="http://www.theimpactsummit.org/">The Impact Summit</a>, a conference for technical students with a passion for social impact,
              and am on the executive board of <a href="http://cssc.cs.brown.edu/">CS for Social Change</a> at Brown.
              I'm particularly interested in the ways that technology can transform how underserved communities
              interact with the legal system, education, and public services. </p>
              <p>I spent this past summer on the engineering team at <a href="https://enotes.com">eNotes.com</a>,
              and did some work with mobile money transfer platforms with the <a href="http://ictd.cs.washington.edu/">Change/ICTD Lab</a> at the University of Washington.</p>
              <p>Always looking for reading and/or coffee recs!</p>
