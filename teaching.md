**Socially Responsible Computing (Head TA)**, May 2019-May 2020.
I pioneered our SRC TA program, which embeds relevant ethics & society content in the core content of individual CS courses. I was one of two Head STAs when the program began summer 2019 with five classes participating in the program for fall 2019; the program doubled in spring 2020 with 20+ STA hires in ten participating courses.
I wrote a reflection on the program's first year [here](http://www.theindy.org/2235){:target="_blank"}.

**CS1420 Machine Learning (Head TA)**, Spring 2020. Tried to manage the chaos of early pandemic with inimitable co-HTAs [Angie Kim](https://twitter.com/angiejwkim){:target="_blank"} and [Dylan Sam](https://dsam99.github.io/){:target="_blank"}. 

**CS1470/2470 Deep Learning (Undergraduate TA & SRC TA)**, Fall 2019.
I wrote a [Language Debiasing Lab](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10zUf914rzKM-nzXAlqLpVJxe1wxYeUDR){:target="_blank"} with my co-STA [Hal](https://haltriedman.com/){:target="_blank"}, and made [a lot of lecture slides](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DMdQB1-ThIb-p5BRQcNJYHEzR9F7cOdx?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}. 

**CS0160 Data Structures & Algorithms (Undergraduate TA)**, Spring 2019.
