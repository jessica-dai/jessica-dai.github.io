	<h2>hi, I'm jessica!</h2>
	<p>I'm a sophomore at Brown studying computer science with a passion for social justice; current topics of academic interest include algorithmic fairness, artificial intelligence/machine learning, and security. I'm particularly interested in the ways that technology can transform how underserved communities interact with the legal system, education, and public services. </p>
	<p>probably spending too much time on twitter and thinking about milk tea :/ </p>
