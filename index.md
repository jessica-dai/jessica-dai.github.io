Hello! I am a first-year PhD student in CS at Berkeley. I spent some time at [Arthur AI](http://www.arthur.ai){:target="_blank"} between Berkeley and Brown, where I did my undergrad (and a lot of [teaching](https://www.jessicad.ai/teaching.html){:target="_blank"}). 

I edit the newsletter at [Reboot](https://reboothq.substack.com/about){:target="_blank"}, where I am also a co-founder; I'm also managing editor for Issue 2 of [Kernel](https://kernelmag.io/){:target="_blank"}, Reboot's annual print magazine. Some of my non-academic writing is [here](http://www.jessicad.ai/writing.html).
