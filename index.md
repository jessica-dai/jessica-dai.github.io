Hello! I am a first-year PhD student in CS at UC Berkeley. I spent some time at [Arthur AI](http://www.arthur.ai){:target="_blank"} between Berkeley and Brown, where I did my undergrad (and a lot of [teaching](https://www.jessicad.ai/teaching.html)). 

I am a cofounder of [Reboot](https://reboothq.substack.com/about){:target="_blank"}, and edited the newsletter June 2021-Aug 2022; I'm also managing editor for [Kernel](https://kernelmag.io/){:target="_blank"}, Reboot's annual print magazine. **(ISSUE 2 IS OUT NOW, AND YOU CAN GET A COPY [HERE](https://kernelmag.io/){:target="_blank"}!!!)** Some of my non-academic writing is [here](http://www.jessicad.ai/writing.html).
