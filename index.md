Hello! I am a ML Engineer at [Arthur AI](http://www.arthur.ai){:target="_blank"}. I recently graduated from Brown with a degree in computer science. 

I'm on the editorial teams at [Reboot](https://reboothq.substack.com/about){:target="blank"}, where I am also a co-founder, and [The Gradient](https://thegradient.pub/){:target="blank"}. Some of my writing is in [Reboot](https://substack.com/profile/2572689-jessica-dai){:target="blank"} and [The College Hill Independent](http://www.theindy.org/author=Jessica%20Dai){:target="blank"}.
