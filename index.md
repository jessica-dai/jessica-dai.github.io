Hello! I am a PhD student in computer science at UC Berkeley. I'm extremely fortunate to be coadvised by [Ben Recht](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/){:target="_blank"} and [Nika Haghtalab](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~nika/){:target="_blank"}, and to be supported by a NSF GRFP. I spent some time at [Arthur AI](http://www.arthur.ai){:target="_blank"} between Berkeley and Brown, where I did my undergrad (and a lot of [teaching](https://www.jessicad.ai/teaching.html)). 

I am a cofounder of [Reboot](https://reboothq.substack.com/about){:target="_blank"}, and editor-in-chief for [Kernel](https://kernelmag.io/){:target="_blank"}, our annual print magazine. **Issue Three is out now! Get your copy [here](https://kernelmag.io/){:target="_blank"} and read my editor's note [here](https://www.kernelmag.io/3/editors-note){:target="_blank"} ðŸ™‚**{: .emph}

I've thought a lot and have feelings about [campus recruiting](http://www.theindy.org/article/1516){:target="_blank"}, [tech ethics education](http://www.theindy.org/article/2235){:target="_blank"}, [Chinese dance](https://letterstomyfriends.substack.com/p/mirrors){:target="_blank"}, and [~ alignment ~](https://joinreboot.org/p/alignment){:target="_blank"}.
