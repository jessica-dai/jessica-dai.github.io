Hello! I am a PhD student in computer science at UC Berkeley. I'm extremely fortunate to be coadvised by [Ben Recht](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/){:target="_blank"} and [Nika Haghtalab](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~nika/){:target="_blank"}, and to be supported by a NSF GRFP. I did undergrad (and a lot of [teaching](https://www.jessicad.ai/teaching.html)) at Brown. 

I am a cofounder of [Reboot](https://reboothq.substack.com/about){:target="_blank"}, and managing editor of [Kernel](https://kernelmag.io/){:target="_blank"}, our annual(ish) print magazine. **Issue Four out now! Get your copy [here](https://shop.kernelmag.io/products/kernel-4){:target="_blank"}{:target="_blank"} ðŸ™‚**{: .emph}

I've thought a lot and have feelings about [campus recruiting](http://www.theindy.org/article/1516){:target="_blank"}, [tech ethics education](http://www.theindy.org/article/2235){:target="_blank"}, [Chinese dance](https://letterstomyfriends.substack.com/p/mirrors){:target="_blank"}, and [~ alignment ~](https://joinreboot.org/p/alignment){:target="_blank"}.
