Hello! I am a ML Engineer at [Arthur AI](http://www.arthur.ai){:target="_blank"}. I recently graduated from Brown with a degree in computer science and will soon (!) start a PhD in CS at Berkeley. 

I'm on the editorial teams at [Reboot](https://reboothq.substack.com/about){:target="_blank"}, where I am also a co-founder, and [The Gradient](https://thegradient.pub/){:target="blank"}. Some of my non-academic writing is [here](http://www.jessicad.ai/writing.html).
