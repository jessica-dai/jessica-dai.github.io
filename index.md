Hello! I study computer science at Brown. Much of my work so far has centered on algorithmic fairness, though I'm also excited about robustness and interpretability in machine learning.

Currently, I'm at [Arthur AI](http://www.arthur.ai){:target="_blank"} on a gap semester, working on observability & model monitoring for safe and responsible ML. This past summer, I was an RA for [Prof. Zachary Lipton](http://zacklipton.com/){:target="_blank"} where I explored macro-level implications of fair (algorithmic) decisionmaking; I've also worked with [Prof. Sarah Brown](http://sarahmbrown.org/){:target="_blank"} on questions of fairness in relation to distribution shift.

From April to July 2020, I co-hosted [Reboot](https://reboothq.substack.com/about){:target="blank"}, a series of talks with authors of recent work about technology, power, and the future -- highlights include Jenny Odell, Ken Liu, and Anna Wiener. Some of my personal writing is [here](https://reading.supply/@jessica){:target="blank"}.
