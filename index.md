Hello! I study computer science at Brown. Much of my work so far has centered on algorithmic fairness, though I'm also excited about robustness and interpretability in machine learning.

Currently, I'm at [Arthur AI](http://localhost:4000/arthur.ai) on a gap semester, working on observability & model monitoring for safe and responsible ML. This past summer, I was an RA for [Prof. Zack Lipton](http://zacklipton.com/) where I explored macro-level implications of fair (algorithmic) decisionmaking; I've also worked with [Prof. Sarah Brown](http://sarahmbrown.org/) on questions of fairness in relation to distribution shift.
