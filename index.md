Hello! I study computer science at Brown. Much of my work so far has centered on algorithmic fairness, though I'm also excited about robustness and interpretability in machine learning.

I recently spent a gap semester at [Arthur AI](http://www.arthur.ai){:target="_blank"}, working on observability & model monitoring for safe and responsible ML. (I'll be returning full-time after I graduate!) This past summer, I was an RA for [Prof. Zachary Lipton](http://zacklipton.com/){:target="_blank"} where I explored macro-level implications of fair (algorithmic) decisionmaking; I've also worked with [Prof. Sarah Brown](http://sarahmbrown.org/){:target="_blank"} on questions of fairness in relation to distribution shift.

In April 2020, I co-created [Reboot](https://reboothq.substack.com/about){:target="blank"}, a series of talks with authors of recent work about technology, power, and the future. After a brief hiatus in fall 2020, I'm back on editorial; I also edit for [The Gradient](https://thegradient.pub/){:target="blank"}. You can find my writing in [Reboot](https://reboothq.substack.com/?sort=search&search=written%20by%20jessica%20dai){:target="blank"} and [The College Hill Independent](http://www.theindy.org/search?query=jessica%20dai){:target="blank"}; some of my personal writing is [here](https://reading.supply/@jessica){:target="blank"}.
