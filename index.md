Hello! I am a ML Engineer at [Arthur AI](http://www.arthur.ai){:target="_blank"}. I recently graduated from Brown with a degree in computer science. 

I'm on the editorial teams at [Reboot](https://reboothq.substack.com/about){:target="blank"} (where I am also a co-founder), and [The Gradient](https://thegradient.pub/){:target="blank"}. You can find my writing in [Reboot](https://reboothq.substack.com/?sort=search&search=written%20by%20jessica%20dai){:target="blank"} and [The College Hill Independent](http://www.theindy.org/search?query=jessica%20dai){:target="blank"}.
