Hello! I am a PhD student in computer science at UC Berkeley. I'm extremely fortunate to be coadvised by [Ben Recht](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/){:target="_blank"} and [Nika Haghtalab](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~nika/){:target="_blank"}, and to be supported by a NSF GRFP. 

Right now, I'm especially interested in methods for post-deployment monitoring, e.g. via [incident reporting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08166){:target="_blank"} or other online/sequential approaches. Feel free to reach out if you're thinking about anything related! 

Outside of my academic work, I am a cofounder of [Reboot](https://reboothq.substack.com/about){:target="_blank"}, and managing editor of [Kernel](https://kernelmag.io/){:target="_blank"}, our annual(ish) print magazine. 
I've also thought a lot and have feelings about [campus recruiting](http://www.theindy.org/article/1516){:target="_blank"}, [tech ethics education](http://www.theindy.org/article/2235){:target="_blank"}, [Chinese dance](https://letterstomyfriends.substack.com/p/mirrors){:target="_blank"}, and [~ alignment ~](https://joinreboot.org/p/alignment){:target="_blank"}.
